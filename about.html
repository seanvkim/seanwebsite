          <p>I'm Sean. 24 years old. Proud Korean-American.</p>
          <p>My dream as a kid was to be an athlete. But I quickly learned that some dreams just aren't meant to come true.</p>
          <p>My early years consisted of constantly being curious, getting dragged to tutoring sessions I didn't want to go to, and doing what I was told to do.</p>
          <p>My father wanted me to be a doctor. My mother wanted me to "do what made me happy." But I quickly came to realize that I didn't know how to think for myself.</p>
          <p>So, I found myself chasing distractions aimlessly because I wanted to fill that void instead of facing it head on.</p>
          <p>It wasn't until years later that I eventually got a grip of myself.</p>
          <p>Because after losing the person who loved me the most, life turned into a world of navigating ups and downs on my own.</p>
          <p>Losing someone hits you in ways that's indescribable. It's the biggest wake up call you can receive because it shows you how valuable living truly is.</p>
          <p>I told myself that she wouldn't want me to live my one life on this Earth, how I was living it back then.</p>
          <p>With no goals, no morals, and no purpose.</p>
          <p>So I drastically took a 180 in my life and rebranded my entire identity (p.s. you can do this at anytime, it's your life)</p>
          <p>I'm currently in the process of building something great that I can look back and be proud of.</p>
          <p>But until then, I hope to connect with anyone and everyone because I believe that everyone's story deserves being told.</p>
          <p>Shoutout my friends.<br>Shoutout my family.<br>Shoutout God, Hebrews 12:11</p>
          <p>✌️- SK</p>
